## Introduction to Our Commitment

We prioritize your privacy forward with transparency and trust. Our local app cares deeply about data control, security certifications, and user autonomy above all else. No compromises ever.

## Data Collection

Our app operates entirely locally on your device. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, usage data, or device details to any servers or third parties. All workflows, links, and configurations stay on your machine.

## Compliance and Certifications

Certified under AICPA SOC 2 for trust services, fully GDPR compliant for data protection, and ISO 27001 for information security management. These ensure our local operations meet global standards.

## No Sharing or Third Parties

Since no data leaves your device, there is no sharing with third parties, advertisers, or services. No cloud sync, no accounts, no external dependencies.

## Security Measures

Data stays secure locally with your device's built-in protections, enhanced by SOC 2, GDPR, and ISO 27001 frameworks. No network access means no remote vulnerabilities or breaches.

## Policy Updates

We may update this policy for app improvements or certification changes. Changes apply only locally; check the app for the latest version.
